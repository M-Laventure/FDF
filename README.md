# FdF

`FdF` is a 3D Wireframe Viewer. **(This project is only runnable under macOS)**

This project consists in coding a program allowing the interpretation of a file written in a specific format "fdf" to display its 3D model in a "Wireframe" representation.

After having modeled this representation, the user is free to modify the model according to the functionalities proposed in the HUD.

## How to run it ?

`git clone https://github.com/M-Laventure/FDF FDF`

`cd FDF `

`make all`

`./FDF test_maps/FileToView`
